				<p>Tobias Morrison is an aging hipster from an age before fixy bikes and steampunk hats. His favorite computer is his first, an Apple ][+ on which he learned to type BASIC from the pages of COMPUTE! magazine. He likes his music heavy and loud. He has strong opinions that he keeps to himself, at least until you have gone too far. Then you will know exactly what he thinks. He loves winter even when seasonal affective disorder kicks in. His Welsh-Irish skin is not suited to exposure to the sun. He has 4 children, a saintly wife, and is chronically tired.</a></p>
