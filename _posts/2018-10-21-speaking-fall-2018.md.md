The folks at [MacTech Conference](http://conference.mactech.com/IKnowASpeaker/TobiasMorrison) invited me to speak at their excellent conference at the [Crowne Plaza Redondo Beach and Marina](https://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/redondo-beach/redcp/hoteldetail) Nov. 7th - 9th. I'll be presenting **Options for Delivering Company Content at Employee On-boarding** which, due to changes in Mojave, will be much different than my PSU talk this summer. 

Early bird pricing has ended, but if you are still interested, you can save $200 by using my [I know a speaker link](http://conference.mactech.com/IKnowASpeaker/TobiasMorrison) to register.
