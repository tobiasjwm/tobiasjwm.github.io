The folks at [MacTech Conference][1] invited me to speak at their excellent conference at the [Crowne Plaza Redondo Beach and Marina][2] Nov. 7th - 9th. I'll be presenting **Options for Delivering Company Content at Employee On-boarding** which, due to changes in Mojave, will be much different than my PSU talk this summer. 

Early bird pricing has ended, but if you are still interested, you can save $200 by using my [I know a speaker link][3] to register.
