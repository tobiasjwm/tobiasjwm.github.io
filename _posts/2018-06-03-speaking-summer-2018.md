I have been accepted as a speaker at [MacAdmins Conference at Penn State][mcps] this July 10-13. This will be my 6th year in attendance but my first year speaking. My talk, [Automating a Great On-boarding Experience][agoe] will touch on using outset, munkipkg, scripts and profiles to deliver organization content, settings and preferences to user accounts.

I love this conference and the community around it and I am very excited for the chance to join the ranks of speakers.
